Hello! I’m Jiayu Bao (包家瑜), an inquisitive undergrad with a passion for different fields of pyschology (like Visual Cognition and Human-Computer Interaction). When I’m not elbow-deep in code or buried in research papers, you’ll find me chasing sunrise vistas on weekend hikes or framing the world through my camera lens. I thrive at the intersection of curiosity and creativity: whether it’s designing intuitive interfaces that enhance user experiences or strumming a new melody with generative music, I’m always exploring how small innovations can spark big ideas. Here’s a quick snapshot of what keeps me ticking:

🎓 Education: B.Sc. in Psychology, Soochow University (GPA 3.9/4.0, ranked 1/40), with honors in Cognitive Psychology & HCI

🔬 Research: 2 papers accepted—2025 Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (CogSci 2025, CCF B indexed) and 2024 International Conference on Neuromorphic Computing (ICNC 2024, IEEE indexed)

🌍 Explorer: Travelled 2 countries and over 40 cities in China

🎨 Newly Interest: Stardew Valley !! Mahjong (麻将) !! (Welcome to invite me to play!)

Let’s dive into how my experiences have shaped my research passions—and why I believe the best solutions start where technology meets humanity.
